# AMY A. SNELL

#### _Information Technology student_

---

Hello, my name is Amy Snell. I am currently an Information Technology student at [University of Missouri-Columbia](www.mizzou.edu). I am excited to return to college and make a drastic career change from self-employed housekeeper to software engineer. I live in Centralia, Missouri with my husband, and my cat, [Cinnamon](cinnamon.md). She is a very good cat, but seems disinterested in coding. Not unlike my husband!

I am from mid-Missouri and I have lived here all my life. I went to school at Missouri State University after high school and studied Music Education. Although I did not pursue a career in music, I still play the French horn in community groups around central Missouri. I am quite passionate about music and I'm always looking for new ways to bring more to the community. Here's some links to a few of the groups I play in:

* [Mid-Missouri Community Orchestra](https://music.missouri.edu/cmp/mid-missouri-community-orchestra-mmco)

* [Columbia Community Band](https://ccbonline.org/)

* [ShowMe Brass](https://www.facebook.com/showmebrass/)

In addition to playing the French horn, I also enjoy participating in my Relay for Life Team "Tiny Bubbles" -- we have so much fun with our events. Last summer, we hosted a Harry Potter Birthday Festival! I enjoy creating the signs for all the events and posting our fun on Facebook...

I am so excited to learn more about information technologies and continue to develop coding skills. Thank you for taking the time to read about me. Take a look at a few projects I'm working on, and my goals going forward:
